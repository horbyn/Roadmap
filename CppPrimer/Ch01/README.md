# CH1 Getting started

## Exer 1.1

> Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

**naming convention**: .cpp  
**compiling rule**: g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test

<br></br>

## Exer 1.2

> Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

[run exer1-2.sh](exer1-2.sh)

<br></br>

## Exer 1.3

> Write a program to print Hello, World on the standard output.

[run exer1-3.sh](exer1-3.sh)

<br></br>

## Exer 1.4

> Our program used the addition operator, +, to add two numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print the product instead.

[run exer1-4.sh](exer1-4.sh)

<br></br>

## Exer 1.5

> We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use a separate statement to print each operand
